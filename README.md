# haunted-places-node
  A simple app created for utilizing Redis and RediSearch to find Haunted Places.
  
  Heavily inspired by [Guy Royse's finding-bigfoot talk](https://github.com/guyroyse/finding) and utilizes Tim Renner's data set on [Haunted Locations](https://data.world/timothyrenner/haunted-places).

  The end-goal is to have a functioning web api and potentially an app that allows you to find nearby Haunted Places based off geolocation and other parameters.
